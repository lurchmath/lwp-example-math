           - First, we have copied into this repository the eqed folder
           - from the main Lurch repository, which in turn was taken from
           - yet another repository (see README in that folder).
           - https://github.com/lurchmath/lurch/tree/master/source/assets/eqed
           - We thus import its relevant scripts here, to add an equation
           - editor plugin to TinyMCE.

           - Part of this application also parses mathematical formulas.
           - The Lurch project publishes two files useful for parsing.
           - First, it publishes an npm package implementing an Earley parser.
           - Second, it includes in its main repository a particular instance
           - of that parser suitable for parsing the contents of the MathQuill
           - equation editor imported above.
           - We import both files from CDNs here:

           - *  Thus ends the section of scripts that were not included in
           - *  simpler example applications of the Lurch Web Platform.
           - *  After this point in the file, we're back to code that is
           - *  more boilerplate, common to most of the example applications.
